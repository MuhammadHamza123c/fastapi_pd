## 📌 Why I Started This

I’m a data science student and backend enthusiast, and I wanted to learn **FastAPI** by doing — not just watching or reading. Most tutorials are too theoretical, so I created this repo with a clear mission:

> **"Solve 10+ practical FastAPI coding tasks every day until I master it."**

Now, I'm sharing this journey to help anyone who wants to learn FastAPI from real tasks — fast and efficiently.
