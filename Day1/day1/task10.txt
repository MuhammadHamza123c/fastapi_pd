- How to run FastAPI code?
Answer: uvicorn main:app --reload

Here 'main' is your Python file name â€” it can be different depending on what you named it.

After running this command in terminal or cmd, you'll get a URL like:

--------------- http://127.0.0.1:8000 ---------------

Just open it in your browser.

If you want to test your API manually, you can do it using the URL.
If you want to use an interface, go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

That's the Swagger UI where you can test all your routes easily.
